# Understanding Check

This activity is called the "Four Fours". It's a math activity around being familiar with the order of operations and its capabilities. The goal is that you have four of the number 4, and you can use any collection of operations to try and produce different whole number outputs. Often the goal is phrased as getting every number from 1 to 20 as an output.

Here is an example of getting 1 as an output:

```
(4 + 4) / (4 + 4)
8 / 8
1
```

The example above meets the requirements because it uses all four 4's (no more, no less). Your goal is come up with as many of these as possible to get as many numbers between 1 and 20 that you can. For each one you come up with, I want you to create a variable to hold onto the answer to the problem and then print it out. Here is the code sample from `Understanding.java` as an example of what I expect:

```java
int variable1 = (4 + 4) / (4 + 4);
System.out.println(variable1);
```

How many can you come up with?

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
