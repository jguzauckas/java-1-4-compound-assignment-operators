# You Do

In the `Do.java` file, accomplish the following:

- Declare a decimal variable called variable1.
- Initialize a whole number variable called variable2 with a value of 10.
- Declare a boolean variable called variable3.
- Assign the value true to variable3.
- Assign the value 9.876 to variable1.
- Create an order of operations problem that results in an integer answer. Print it out.
- Create an order of operations problem that results in a decimal answer. Print it out.
- Create an order of operations problem that results in an ArithmeticException without actually writing `/ 0`. Try to print it out.

Your goal is the eliminate the errors (highlighted in red) and instead ensure there is only warnings (highlighted in yellow), as that means there are no data type issues, just issues with the variables not being used further.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
