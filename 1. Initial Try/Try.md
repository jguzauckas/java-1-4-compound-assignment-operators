# Initial Try

Using the starting sample code in the `Try.java` file, try to finish the declarations, initializations, assignments, and operations.

---

Line 3 - finish declaring variable1 as a decimal.

Line 4 - finish declaring variable2 as a whole number.

Line 5 - finish initializing variable3 as a boolean that is true.

Line 6 - finish initializing variable4 as a decimal that is 567.123.

Line 7 - finish assigning variable1 the value 1.234.

Line 8 - finish assigning variable2 the value 17.

---

Line 10 - Fill in the print statement with the value that should be printed by the operations in Line 9.

Line 12 - Fill in the print statement with the value that should be printed by the operations in Line 11.

Your goal is the eliminate the errors (highlighted in red) and instead ensure there is only warnings (highlighted in yellow), as that means there are no data type issues, just issues with the variables not being used further.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
