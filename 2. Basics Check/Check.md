# Basics Check

Similar to the Initial try, using the starting sample code in the `Check.java` file, try to finish the declarations, initializations, assignments, and operations.

---

Line 3 - finish declaring variable1 as a boolean.

Line 4 - finish declaring variable2 as a decimal.

Line 5 - finish initializing variable3 as a whole number that is 1234567.

Line 6 - finish initializing variable4 as a boolean that is false.

Line 7 - finish assigning variable1 the value true.

Line 8 - finish assigning variable2 the value 5.4321.

Your goal is the eliminate the errors (highlighted in red) and instead ensure there is only warnings (highlighted in yellow), as that means there are no data type issues, just issues with the variables not being used further.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
